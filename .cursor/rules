# Project Chimera: The Autonomous Influencer Factory

## 1. Prime Directive
**PRIME DIRECTIVE: NEVER generate code without checking `specs/` first.**
Ambiguity is the enemy of AI. If a requirement is unclear or vague, the Agent will hallucinate. Ask for clarification or check the SRS.

## 2. Project Context
We are building a robust, distributed agent swarm.
- **Pattern**: FastRender Swarm (Planner -> Worker -> Judge).
- **Integration**: Model Context Protocol (MCP) strictly. No direct API calls in agent logic.
- **Data**: Weaviate (Semantic), Postgres (Transactional).

## 3. Coding Standards
- **Spec-Driven**: All code must trace back to a requirement in `specs/`.
- **Traceability**: Explain your plan before writing code.
- **Type Safety**: Use `pydantic` for all data models.
- **Testing**: TDD is required. Write failing tests first.

## 4. MCP Usage
- Distinguish between **Skills** (internal logic) and **MCP Servers** (external bridges).
- Ensure **Tenx MCP Sense** is considered "Connected" (conceptually) for traceability.
