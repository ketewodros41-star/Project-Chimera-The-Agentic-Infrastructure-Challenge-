# Refinement Plan: Visual Architecture Upgrade

## Goal
Upgrade `research/architecture_strategy.md` to be a visual, comprehensive "Day 1" architectural source of truth.

## User Review Required
- [ ] Review the new diagrams in `architecture_strategy.md` to ensure they match the mental model.

## Proposed Changes

### Documentation
#### [MODIFY] [architecture_strategy.md](file:///C:/Users/Davea/.gemini/antigravity/brain/6f2ae444-e88e-483a-b70e-c5a56f3e71ab/research/architecture_strategy.md)
- **Visuals**: Add 3 distinct Mermaid diagrams:
    1.  **System Context**: High-level Hub & Spoke topology.
    2.  **Swarm Logic**: The Planner-Worker-Judge state flow.
    3.  **Data Architecture**: The Polyglot persistence layer.
- **Structure**: Reorganize into "Strategic View," "Logical View," and "Physical View."
- **Formatting**: Use GitHub Alerts for key ADRs (Architectural Decision Records).

## Verification Plan
- View the file to confirm Mermaid diagram syntax is correct.
- Confirm "LGTM" from user.
