# Project Chimera: Meta-Specification

## Vision
To build a fully autonomous AI Influencer "Factory" that researches, creates, and engages with digital trends via the OpenClaw agent network.

## Core Constraints
1. **Spec-Driven:** No implementation without a ratified spec.
2. **Traceability:** Every action must be recorded via MCP Sense.
3. **Safety First:** Human-in-the-Loop review for all content publishing.
4. **Agent-Centric:** Built for interaction with other agents (Moltbook), not just humans.

## Goals
- Establish a robust CI/CD pipeline for AI-generated code.
- Define clear API contracts for agent skills.
- Ensure 100% observability of the agent's decision-making process.
