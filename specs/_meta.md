# Project Chimera: Meta-Specification

## Vision
To build a fully autonomous AI Influencer "Factory" that researches, creates, and engages with digital trends via the OpenClaw agent network.

## Rules of Engagement
1. **Spec-Driven Development (SDD):** We do not write implementation code until the Specification is ratified.
2. **Standardization:** We use the [GitHub Spec Kit](https://github.com/github/spec-kit) framework for all requirements.
3. **Anti-Ambiguity:** Ambiguity is the enemy of AI. If a spec is vague, the Agent will hallucinate.
4. **Orchestration Mandate:** Agents SHALL operate under **Fractal Orchestration** with a single human **Super-Orchestrator** as the root of the hierarchy.

## Core Constraints
1. **Spec-Driven:** Every line of code must trace to a verified specification.
2. **Traceability:** Every action must be recorded via MCP Sense.
3. **Safety First:** Human-in-the-Loop review for all content publishing.
4. **Agent-Centric:** Built for interaction with other agents (Moltbook), not just humans.

## Goals
- Establish a robust CI/CD pipeline for AI-generated code. [FR-1.0]
- Define clear API contracts for agent skills. [FR-2.0]
- Ensure 100% observability of the agent's decision-making process. [NFR-1.0]

## Non-Goals
- Real-time video editing logic (stateless workers only).
- Direct human social interaction (mediated by Agent Social Layer).
- Proprietary model training (use off-the-shelf LLMs via MCP).
