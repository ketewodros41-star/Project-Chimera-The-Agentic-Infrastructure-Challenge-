# Chimera Command Center: End-to-End Governance UI

This directory contains the high-fidelity dashboard for the Project Chimera Agent Swarm. It demonstrates the **Human-in-the-Loop (HITL)** interaction required for professional AI governance.

## 🏗️ Implementation Overview
The dashboard is built as a self-contained, glassmorphic web application. It uses a cosmic dark theme to reflect the "Factory of the Future" mission.

### Core Components
- **Swarm Health Monitor**: Visualizes compute load and semantic memory usage.
- **Live Trend Feed**: Simulates real-time trend discovery from OpenClaw and Moltbook.
- **HITL Approval Queue**: A dedicated workspace for human operators to ratify or reject agent-generated content before publication.

## 🛡️ Governance Integration
- **Dimension 5 Enforcement**: The UI provides the physical workstation for confidence-based tiered escalation.
- **Prime Directive visibility**: The core project mandate is permanently displayed in the footer as a reminder to all operators.

## 🎮 How to Run
1. Open [index.html](index.html) in any modern web browser.
2. Interact with the **Approval Queue** to simulate ratifying an agent's work.
3. Observe the real-time feedback banners and dynamic queue updates.

## 📝 Walkthrough Summary
- **Visual Design**: Premium glassmorphism with subtle micro-animations for agent status.
- **Functionality**: Mock state management in `index.js` handles the lifecycle of approval tasks.
- **End-to-End Proof**: This UI bridges the gap between autonomous agent logic and human oversight, fulfilling the requirement for a complete system interaction model.
